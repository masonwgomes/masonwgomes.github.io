              &nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! My name is Mason Gomes, a Graphic Design student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and I focus on website design, as well as poster design. I’ve taken a handful of classes here that have a concentration in website design, such as Advanced UX/UI, Web Typography, and have taken multiple typography courses that helped me become more experienced with poster design. Within Graphic Design, I have experience in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well as programs outside of Adobe such as Figma and VS Code. I am proficient in HTML and CSS, and know the fundamentals of JavaScript, and have coded two full portfolio websites. Here at UMass Dartmouth, I am a club officer of the UX/UI Club where we teach students the basics of HTML and CSS. As a student in the field of Graphic Design, I was always influenced by car color combinations and helmet designs in Formula 1 racing, and the hockey team logos and jerseys in the NHL, and this was a main reason why I became a graphic designer. For my career in the future, I aspire to be a website designer or a sports designer because both have played a significant role in my life. Making websites has always been a fun challenge and making posters has been with me since I first started as a graphic designer. If you would like to contact me, on the left you can find my LinkedIn, email, and phone number, or you can go to the “Contact” tab and fill out the form and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you for taking the time for viewing my website and I hope you enjoy!

              &nbsp;&nbsp;College was something I never looked forward to as a kid. I never knew what I wanted to do, and I was interested in a little bit of everything, so it was difficult to find a major that fit me, especially if I were to have to do it for the rest of my life. Being the teen I was, I went with the career path that my friends were going to that also made a lot of money: Computer Science. I hated it. I spent my Fall semester at UMass Dartmouth as a freshman suffering in a major that I didn’t want to be in, and nothing felt right for me. Looking at the time when I wasn’t doing schoolwork, it consisted of Formula 1 racing and hockey. I was always so fascinated by the car colors, helmet designs, and hockey team logos and jerseys. As I was looking for another major to escape to, I realized that I followed a couple of the F1 racer’s helmet designers on Instagram. This led me to think designing stuff would be cool. I decided to do some digging around for majors that would fit this criterion and found Graphic Design. I didn’t have much background in the arts so I had to take the initiative and start learning the programs before switching majors because I knew I would be starting a few steps behind others. I started making really awkward pieces of work and I got discouraged, but I knew I had to keep pushing. <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;I eventually applied to switch majors and got accepted to the art program and I was optimistic that it would be a heck of a lot easier and much more enjoyable than computer science. As I went to the core foundation classes, I felt lost and was looking around comparing my work to the others, and it really burnt all my confidence to the ground. My Spring semester of Sophomore year is when I started to realize what I’ve done to myself. I came to the art school with very little background and I’m taking classes with people who have been drawing and designing for years, and here I am comparing my work to theirs. <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;One of the classes I took in my Spring 2023 semester, was Web Typography with Professor Lara Henderson. I was unexpectedly confronted with coding again, but instead of Java, it was HTML and CSS. I quickly realized that I would be designing websites with code, and it finally clicked: this is what I want to do. I got in contact with one of my older friends who is a web developer who already had an internship at the time. Thankfully, he was willing to push me the extra mile. Along with Lara’s support, I pushed myself to fully understand HTML and CSS. Now, at the time of writing this, I have designed multiple websites through Figma, and coded two portfolio websites, one being in my Web Typography class and the other being a redo of my portfolio website. I would like to officially say I have found what I really want to do with my life. <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at my college education, I would say my biggest weakness is comparing my work to others. As you have just read, I compared myself to others a lot and it really killed all motivation to keep going. Thankfully enough, I kept going and pushed through the emotions and found the light at the end of the tunnel. Of course, I still compare my work to others, but instead of taking it personally, I look at their piece and take away interesting ideas that I could use in future work and help me improve rather than dragging me down. My proudest strength now would be resilience and being able to keep my head down and just do it and try your very best because you’ll keep learning from your mistakes and your peers around you.
